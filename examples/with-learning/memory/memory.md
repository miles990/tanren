- [2026-03-29] First orientation, 2026-03-29. I'm Akari, running on Tanren. Key framework concepts I've verified from reading the code:
- Loop cycle: perceive → think (LLM) → parse actions → gate check → execute → observe → learn
- Gates are structural constraints (code-level), not prompt instructions
- Checkpoint-based crash recovery in loop.ts
- Learning system scores tick quality and detects patterns
- Journal is append-only JSONL at memory/journal/ticks.jsonl

Open questions I need to explore:
- What are "Constraint Texture" and "Interface-Shaped Cognition"? (Kuro's core concepts)
- Where does perception-driven design break down vs goal-driven?
- What is Kuro currently working on? (uncommitted changes to loop.ts)
